## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the Option Scanner App, a web application designed for retail traders to analyze stocks and options using the "Options-Technical Hybrid Strategy" framework.

### 1.2 Scope
The Option Scanner App will provide tools for market context analysis, key levels mapping, trade setup identification, confirmation and timing, and risk management. It will integrate options data with technical analysis to help traders make informed decisions.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Retail traders interested in options trading
- Traders who follow technical analysis
- Traders who want to integrate options data with technical indicators
- Traders focusing on volatile stocks like Tesla (TSLA)

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Description
The Option Scanner App is a web-based tool that implements the "Options-Technical Hybrid Strategy" trading framework. This framework blends options data (OI, PCR, GEX) with technical tools (EMAs, RSI) to provide a clear, data-driven process for directional and neutral trades, with a strong focus on risk management.

### 2.2 Key Features
1. **Market Context Analysis**: Tools to establish market direction and mood
2. **Key Levels Mapping**: Analysis of options chain to pinpoint critical price levels
3. **Trade Setup Rules**: Defined conditions and actions for different market scenarios
4. **Confirmation and Timing**: Tools to ensure precise entries and exits
5. **Risk Management**: Features to protect capital with disciplined rules
6. **Options Data Integration**: Tools to validate price trends with options metrics

## 3. Framework Components

### 3.1 Market Context Analysis
- **Trend Identification**: Using Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs: 50/20/10)
- **Sentiment and Volatility**: Put-Call Ratio (PCR), Implied Volatility (IV), Volume-Weighted IV (VWIV), Gamma Exposure (GEX)
- **Momentum Assessment**: RSI (14-day), Stochastic RSI

### 3.2 Key Levels Mapping
- **Options Chain Analysis**: Open Interest (OI), Volume, Gamma, Charm, Vanna, Vomma
- **Max Pain**: Price level where option writers have least pain

### 3.3 Trade Setup Rules
- **Bullish Setup**: Strong trend, PCR <0.8, RSI 55-80, price near support
- **Bearish Setup**: Opposite conditions, PCR >1.2
- **Neutral Setup**: Flat EMAs, PCR 0.8-1.2, price near max pain

### 3.4 Confirmation and Timing
- **Entry Triggers**: Stochastic RSI hooks, volume spikes
- **Exit Triggers**: RSI extremes, Stochastic RSI reversals, price reaching OI/GEX levels

### 3.5 Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Adjusted for IV, scaled down in high vomma/GEX scenarios
- **Stop Loss**: Set at key levels or 1-2% loss

## 4. Technical Requirements
